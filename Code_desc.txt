

1) As per the main process, 
	-> Downscale the image size 
	-> Find the Canny edges using cv2.Canny()
	-> Find the Contours in this Canny image
	-> Draw a box or roi covering the contours
	-> Remove the ret of the picture other than the region of interest
	-> This gives us just the signature to work with
	-> Convert this image from RGB to GRAY scale
	-> Create a mask using Adaptive Thresholding (cv2.adaptiveThreshold()) to get the background to black and the signature stokes to a different color

Important OpenCV Algorithms used :
1) cv2.dilate
	Dilation is a basic morphological operation used to remove noise and to isolate individual elements in a given image.

2) cv2.findContours	
	To find the Contours in the image. As part of the pre-processing increasingly aggressive dilation is performed until there are a few connectd connected components

3) cv2.Canny
	This is to find the Canny edges in the image and in turn to detect the contours.

4) cv2.adaptiveThreshold
	It is used to separate desirable foreground image( signature ) from th background.
